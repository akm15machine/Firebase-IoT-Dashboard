This is just a basic demo to show, that Firebase Realtime Database can be implemented to build IoT projects from scratch, which can work in realtime. Instead of sticking to pre-existing solutions, I have tried to promote a more "building from the scratch" approach in learning IoT mainly for the beginners.<br>
This project enabled us to explore:
1. How to connect a database on the client-side (app/website)
2. How to connect to a database (Firebase RTDB to be specific) from an IoT device.
3. How to read from or write to a database from client-side.
4. Implementing a non-blocking solution to call functions at regular intervals on the microcontroller.

Just explore through the well-documented source codes provided in this repository which will explain the workings of almost every piece of code.
